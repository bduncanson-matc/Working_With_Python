[Lab-Python] Functions
________________


Function checklist:
Create a function checklist for later exercises. Write these checks on an index card and keep it with you while you complete the rest of these exercises or until you feel you do not need the index card anymore.
Creating the function: 
1. Did you start your function definition with def?
2. Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
3. Did you put an open parenthesis right after the function name?
4. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis separated by commas?
5. Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
6. Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon after the arguments?
7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces?
   * No more, no less.
   * Make sure if you use the tab key it is set to convert tabs to 4 spaces
8. Did you “end” your function by going back to writing with no indent?
   * It is called dedenting
Running/Calling the function:
1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
2. Did you put the ‘(‘ character after the name to run it?
3. Did you put the values you want into the parentheses separated by commas?
4. Did you end the function call with a ‘)’ character?

Use these two checklists on the remaining lessons until you do not need them anymore.
Finally, repeat this a few times to yourself: To “run,” “call,” or “use” a function each means the same thing.


Get Started:
   1. Create a folder for the week we are in.  For example, if this is week 5 of your class schedule, create a folder called week5 (without spaces).
   2. Navigate to the weekly folder.
Script 1 - Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
Create a script called f2c.py in your weekly directory.


   * Create a function that will convert from degrees fahrenheit to celsius


                Formula:
Convert 68 degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius:
        (68°F - 32) × 5/9 = 20 °C
Ex:
degrees_fahrenheit = 32 
(degrees_fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
Output:
0
	        
   * DO NOT PRINT THE RESULT FROM IN THE FUNCTION
   * Return the result to the calling program


   * Create a main function that 
   * Asks the user for a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
   * Pass the value as an argument to your conversion function
   * Prints the result of the function 
   * Test your script by running it directly
Script 2 - Temp Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
Create a script called c2f.py in your weekly directory.


   * Create a function that will convert from degrees celsius to fahrenheit
                Formula:
Convert 68 degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius:
        (0°C × 9/5) + 32 = 32°F
Ex:
degrees_celsius = 0
(degrees_celsius * 9/5) + 32
Output:
32
	

        
   1. DO NOT PRINT THE RESULT FROM IN THE FUNCTION
   1. Return the result to the calling program


   * Create a main function that 
   1. Asks the user for a temperature in degrees Celsius
   1. Pass the value as an argument to your conversion function
   2. Prints the result of the function 
   * Test your script by running it directly
Script 3 - Temp Conversion (Main)
Create a script called tempconversion.py in your weekly directory


   * Import the c2f and f2c scripts above
   * Ask the user to input a temperature
   * Ask the user to input a measure (Fahrenheit or Celsius)
   * Call the appropriate function from the imported file
   * Print the result
   * Test your script by running it directly


Submission:
When you have completed your scripts and tested that the output matches the directions above, add, commit and push your changes to GitHub.  It’s always a good idea to check that your files/changes uploaded to GitHub correctly, by looking at them in GitHub with your browser.


   1. Create an Issue in GitHub to signal you are ready for grading:
  



   2. Give your issue a meaningful title including the week and assignment name.


  

Your instructor will provide feedback in the GitHub issue and post your grade in Blackboard.
