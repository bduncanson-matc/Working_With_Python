[Lab-Python] Dictionaries
________________


  Get Started:
1. Create a folder for the week we are in.  For example, if this is week 4 of your class schedule, create a folder called week4 (without spaces).
2. Navigate to the weekly folder.
3. Using nano (or another editor of your choice), create a script called dictionaries.py.  Make sure to set the permissions to allow python to execute.
________________
To Do:
For each of the listed tasks add the Python code that will accomplish the task.  It’s wise to use comments in your script so you understand which code goes with each task.
1. Make a dictionary containing the following FQDN to IP address mappings:


server1.testlab.com -> 192.168.1.10
server2.testlab.com -> 192.168.1.11
server3.testlab.com -> 192.168.1.12
server4.testlab.com -> 192.168.1.13
server5.testlab.com -> 192.168.1.14
server6.testlab.com -> 192.168.1.15




2. List all of the FQDN’s in your dictionary


3. List all of the IP Addresses in your dictionary


4. List all of the full records (key/value pairs)


5. Add a few more names to address mappings. Continue the ip address sequence above for their values.


server7.testlab.com
server8.testlab.com


6. Test if server2.testlab.com is contained in your dictionary. 


7. Test if server10.testlab.com is contained is your dictionary.
