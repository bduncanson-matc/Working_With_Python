Midterm Activity 3: 
Slicing
________________


Introduction
For this step, you will read a file into a list and use slicing to get to the famous quote.


Concepts used in this script include:
* Reading a file into a list                                                [ Discussion 6 ]
* Iterating through lines of a file                                        [ Discussion 6 ]
* Breaking a string into individual words using split()                        [ Discussion 4 ]
* Joining words into a string using join()                                [ Discussion 4  ]
* Slicing a string                                                                [ Discussion 4  ]
To Do


1. In your repository create a folder called midterm (if it doesn’t already exist)
2. Click here to download the file to slice. Save it to your midterm directory. 


3. Create a script:
   1. Name: midterm-slicing.py
   2. Print out your first and last name to the screen in this format:
      1. print(“Name:<your first name> <your last name>”)
   3. Save it into your local git repository directory


4. In your script, create a variable for each item below and use a single slice to get the correct words from the file:
   1. The third word from the end of the list
   2. The third through fifth word of the list
   3. The 10th word from the end of the file and every other word for a total of 3 words.
   4. The 11th through 13th word 
   5. The 19th - 21st words from the end of the file 


5. Add each word to a new string called “quote”.  Hint, some of your slices will return a list of strings instead of a single string. You can use the join() function to join the list of words into a single list.


6. Print the final quote out to the screen.  Note, if you want to remove end of line characters, you can use the replace() function in Python.


7. Test your script, to ensure you see the following output:
   1. "Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you are right."
