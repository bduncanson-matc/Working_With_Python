[Lab-Python] JSON (ipinfo.io)
________________


To Do:
This week we will be using the json module to translate JSON into a Python dictionary.  We will use the web API ipinfo.io which is a straight forward interface for retrieving information about an IP Address such as location and organization.


1. Create a folder for the week we are in.  For example, if this is week 7 of your class schedule, create a folder called week7 (without spaces).
2. In this weekly folder, create a script called json.py.
3. Ensure your script can take in an argument with a flag of ‘-ip’ so that your user can pass in an IP Address. Hint: Look back at the ArgParse discussion for details on how to do this.
4. Import the web and json modules and make a request to the ipinfo.io API.  An example URL is http://ipinfo.io/172.217.8.206/json.  You will need to use the -ip argument to build this URL.
5. Using the json module, load the json from the web response into a Python dictionary called myDict.
6. Using a for loop, step through each item in the dictionary response and print both the key name and value.


The output should look something like this (depending on the ip address):


  





Submission:
When you have completed your script and tested that the output matches the directions above, add, commit and push your changes to GitHub.  It’s always a good idea to check that your files/changes uploaded to GitHub correctly, by looking at them in GitHub with your browser.


1. Create an Issue in GitHub to signal you are ready for grading:
  



2. Give your issue a meaningful title and include any comments about things you want specific feedback on or questions you may have about the assignment.


  

Your instructor will provide feedback in the GitHub issue and post your grade in Blackboard.
