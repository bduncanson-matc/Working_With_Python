[Lab-Python] Using Argparse
________________


Get Started:
1. Create a folder for the week we are in.  For example, if this is week 6 of your class schedule, create a folder called week6 (without spaces).
2. Navigate to the weekly folder.
3. Using nano (or another editor of your choice), create a script called arguments.py.  Make sure to set the permissions to allow python to execute.
To Do:


Step 1: Using the argparse module, setup arguments so that you would get the following help text:


  



Step 2: In your script, print the value of your integer, string, float and list arguments.  Hint, there is an example provided at the end of this topic slides.




Submission:
When you have completed your script and tested that the output matches the directions above, add, commit and push your changes to GitHub.  It’s always a good idea to check that your files/changes uploaded to GitHub correctly, by looking at them in GitHub with your browser.


1. Create an Issue in GitHub to signal you are ready for grading:
  



2. Give your issue a meaningful title and include any comments about things you want specific feedback on or questions you may have about the assignment.


  

3. Optional: Include any comments about things you want specific feedback on or questions you may have about the assignment.
Your instructor will provide feedback in the GitHub issue and post your grade in Blackboard.
