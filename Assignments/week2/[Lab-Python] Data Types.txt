[Lab-Python] Data Types
________________


Get Started:
1. Create a folder for the week we are in.  For example, if this is week 2 of your class schedule, create a folder called week2 (without spaces).
2. Navigate to the weekly folder.
3. Using nano (or another editor of your choice), create a script called sequences.py  Make sure to set the permissions to allow python to execute.
To Do:
Create a line or lines of python code that will output the format shown:


Example: 
1. Output: ‘Hello Timmy’
2. Line of code in python script: print(“Hello Timmy”)


Steps:
1. Create the following variables in your script:
   1. varString = "Here is a nice string to slice"
   2. varList = [ "Here", "is", "a", "nice", "list", "to", "slice" ]  
2. Using slicing on varString create the following output using one line of code:
   1. 'e is a nice string to slice'
   2. 'Her'
   3. 'e is a ni'
   4. 'Hr sanc tigt lc'        
   5. 'ecils ot gnirts ecin a si ereH'
3. Using slicing on varList create the following output using one line of code:
   1. ['slice', 'to', 'list', 'nice', 'a', 'is', 'Here'] 
   2. ['a', 'is', 'Here']
   3. ['a', 'nice']
   4. ['Here', 'nice', 'slice']
   5. ['is', 'a', 'nice', 'list', 'to', 'slice']
4. Using a for loop, print out each element of varString one line at a time.
5. Using a for loop, print out each element of varList one line at a time.
